Airlines Reservation System

Developed using Red Hat CodeReady Studio, this Airlines Reservation System is a comprehensive web-based application designed for efficient management of flight reservations. The platform enables users to search for flights, book tickets, manage reservations, and access real-time flight information. Leveraging MySQL for robust data storage and management, the system emphasizes scalability, flexibility, and user-friendliness.

The system's frontend is crafted with XHTML for structured web page design and CSS for a visually appealing interface. XML is used to manage structured data efficiently, ensuring smooth data flow and real-time updates. The application architecture emphasizes high responsiveness and usability, providing a seamless experience for both users and administrators. This project also underscores the importance of modular development, enabling ease of maintenance and feature scalability to adapt to growing demands.
